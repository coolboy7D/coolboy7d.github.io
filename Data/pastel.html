            <p>
                Pastel is a female book object who shares an apartment with <a href="./raven.html">Raven</a>. The two have become great friends over time.
                Pastel sells digital art commissions online in order to pay her part of her and <a href="./raven.html">Raven</a>'s rent.<br>
                Pastel's <a href="./abilities.html">Ability</a> is that she can transform any stylus she is currently holding into a weapon. Which weapon it
                converts into depends on the stylus she's holding. Her own stylus, when converted into a weapon, results in a katana. <br>
                Pastel always tries her best to be nice to people, as she is aware this is how she makes good friends, like <a href="./raven.html">Raven</a>.
                She will try her best to give you second chances, though she <em>does</em> know when enough is enough and will be sure to make sure
                you know that. <a href="./raven.html">Raven</a> and Pastel happen to make an amazing duo together, particulary due to their shared
                living situation, and shared interests.
