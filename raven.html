            Raven has coding capabilities, and is able to use his skills to alter his environment! He isn't quite an expert yet, so he can't quite warp
            reality or anything like that, but he is skillful enough to alter little things around him. His visor helps him focus enough to do his thing,
            and it has some HUDs that help him know what certain things around him correspond to in code." <br>

            Raven is a male book object who is absolutely in <em>love</em> with programming. He spends all his free time doing programming, his <em>job</em>
            is programming...<br>
            He also lives in an apartment with <a href="./pastel">Pastel</a>. His job as a programmer allows him to have enough money to pay his half
            of the rent as well as go shopping each week for him and <a href="./pastel">Pastel</a>.<br>
            Raven's <a href="./abilities">Ability</a> is that he can alter specific parts of his environment using his visor. Not reality breaking
            stuff, (at least not <em>yet</em>), but he can do basic things like alter the gravity in a small radius around himself. Think about this
            <a href="./abilities">Ability</a> like he can tweak some lines of code of his environment.<br><br>
