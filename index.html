    <!--2/4/26:-->
    <p>
        2/4/26: RELEASED ON GITHUB PAGES MY GOAT!! Overhauled Raven's page, too. Other overhauls coming later today probably. Screwed around in 30 minutes<br>
        trying to get Visual Studio Code to link to the GitHub repository... Keymaster's page no longer gives an error 412! Added a tab image at the top,<br>
        too!! It's currently Raven for most pages, but I plan on having it be each individual character for each of their own pages. The only page that<br>
        doesn't currently have Raven as a tab icon is Pastel, who instead has Pastel as a tab icon. Also changed Keymaster's defining trait to Confidence,<br>
        because Entitlement was a little <em>too</em> on the nose.
    </p>
    <!--2/3/26:-->
    <p>
        2/3/26: Added changelog and Cool's Encyclopedia Homepage and Pastel, Raven, Keymaster, and Abilities page. Though, only homepage, Raven, and Pastel<br>
        are availible. The rest just hand you an Error 412: Precondition Failed. The precondition being the page contents existing. Made every page look nicer.<br>
        Added a bunch of comments in the code, too. I really need those to see through all my spaghetti noodles... There's audio on homepage too!
