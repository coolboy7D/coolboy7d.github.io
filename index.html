    <!--Beta 1.1.1-->
        Beta 1.1.1: Forgot to move Starlight out of the Incomplete Pages category lol.<br><br>
    <!--Beta 1.1.0-->
        Beta 1.1: Decided to start going by version numbers instead of days. Easier to keep track that way, y'know? Especially because counting by days
        can be weird to read as future statements could contradict older statements based on newer updates made throughout the day... Anyway..! The update
        today was a wee bit delayed but it's here!! Updated many of the pages, and added Starlight, with Seb and Shatter soon to come!<br><br>
    <!--2/4/26:-->
        2/4/26: RELEASED ON GITHUB PAGES MY GOAT!! Overhauled Raven's page, too. Other overhauls coming later today probably. Screwed around in 30 minutes
        trying to get Visual Studio Code to link to the GitHub repository... Keymaster's page no longer gives an error 412! Added a tab image at the top,
        too!! It's currently Raven for most pages, but I plan on having it be each individual character for each of their own pages. The only page that
        doesn't currently have Raven as a tab icon is Pastel, who instead has Pastel as a tab icon. Also changed Keymaster's defining trait to Confidence,
        because Entitlement was a little <em>too</em> on the nose. Added version number at the bottom of every page!! The naming convention is right above
        it. Changed the way page files were stored internally to allow for easier, dynamic version numbers. Keymaster is also now in the "Charater Pages"
        section in All Pages page. Abilities page added, being the first Mechanic Page. It also was made with Raven Page Overhaul (hereby referred to as RPO)
        It also has been moved to the Mechanic Pages section in the pages page, leaving nothing incomplete anymore! Overhauled every availible page. They're
        also all mobile friendly now!! Yay!! <small>There's something new in the works for tomorrow...</small><br><br>
    <!--2/3/26:-->
        2/3/26: Added changelog and Cool's Encyclopedia Homepage and Pastel, Raven, Keymaster, and Abilities page. Though, only homepage, Raven, and Pastel
        are availible. The rest just hand you an Error 412: Precondition Failed. The precondition being the page contents existing. Made every page look nicer.
        Added a bunch of comments in the code, too. I really need those to see through all my spaghetti noodles... There's audio on homepage too!
